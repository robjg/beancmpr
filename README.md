Bean Compare
============

Bean Compare started a utility for comparing Java Beans, hence the name. It then included 
Collections, Arrays and Maps as types it can compare. It now also supports data from 
[Dido](https://github.com/robjg/dido) which allows it to compare Database tables, CSV files, simple JSON
and any other type of Dido Data.

Bean Compare is intended to be used as an [Oddjob](https://github.com/robjg/oddjob) Oddball but can be
used stand alone in code. 

Requires Java 11
